## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I continued working with a mobile-first workflow, introduced working with variables, and worked with pseudo selectors.

### Continued development

This isn't a specific or concrete thing to work on, but I had a heck of a time figuring out the desktop layout for this. I also know the width of the text box vs the width of the image is off on desktop, and I can't get it to be the same. I'd like to return to this project in a few weeks once I've made more progress with my HTML/CSS skills and see if I can take a different approach to making this look closer to the design.
